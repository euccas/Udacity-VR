## Project 1: Hello World

A simple game. But it's fun for a VR starter. Platform: Google Cardboard. 

- You can try to hit the cube, and it will disapper. Move around to find where the cube moves to.
- Use the buttons on the floor to change day/night (watch the sun rises and falls), change colors, and get random cubes.

## Project 2: Modern Apartment

Build an apartment scene with lighting and custom animation. Platform: Google Cardboard.
